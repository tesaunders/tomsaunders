## Abstract

Retrospective host range testing is essential for understanding the physiological host range of introduced biological control agents (BCAs) and updating forecasts of non-target risks. It is especially important to conduct this work if there was no host range testing prior to release of the agent. *Trissolcus basalis* Wollaston was released in New Zealand in 1949 against green vegetable bug (*Nezara viridula* [L.]), but host range testing was never undertaken, and subsequent work in the 1960s was only of a qualitative nature and remains incomplete. The host-parasitoid complex between New Zealand pentatomids, *T. basalis*, and the native pentatomid parasitoid *Trissolcus oenone* Dodd, is therefore poorly understood. We conducted no-choice oviposition tests between the two resident *Trissolcus* species and all available New Zealand pentatomid species to characterise the physiological (=fundamental) host ranges of these parasitoids. We present the results of the first retrospective host-specificity study on *T. basalis* in New Zealand. Our results show *T. basalis* attacks and develops in all nine pentatomid taxa we exposed it to (including the endemic alpine species *Hypsithocus hudsonae* Bergroth), while *T. oenone* attacks and develops in seven out of eight pentatomid species we tested it against (and its capacity to attack *H. hudsonae* remains unknown). Parasitism efficiencies for all treatments exceeded 60%, while development times were similar for both parasitoids regardless of host. We discuss the importance of physiological host range testing for understanding potential non-target effects. *Trissolcus japonicus* Ashmead (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) was recently approved for release in New Zealand against brown marmorated stink bug *Halyomorpha halys* St√•l (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), subject to its potential establishment, and we examine our results in the context of potential competition between introduced parasitoids for non-target species.
