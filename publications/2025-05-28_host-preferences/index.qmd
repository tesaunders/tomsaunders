## Abstract

Current approaches to assessing potential non-target risks associated with biological control agents are conservative, and they often rely on oviposition experiments conducted in quarantine laboratories. By their nature, such tests offer robust evidence of a parasitoidâ€™s ability to attack and develop in a host. However, they exclude many important chemical cues present in the natural environment, which play a key role in the ability of a parasitoid to search for and locate hosts. We conducted a series of experiments with *Trissolcus basalis* and *Trissolcus oenone* to better understand the chemical basis mediating differences in host-specificity between these parasitoids. First, we compared the searching behaviour of *T. basalis* and *T. oenone* in open arena arrestment bioassays contaminated with footprint compounds of *Nezara viridula* or *Cuspicona simplex*. *Trissolcus basalis* spent four times longer searching for *N. viridula* than *C. simplex*, while *T. oenone* spent four times longer searching for *C. simplex* than *N. viridula*. We then conducted competition experiments to assess factors important to determining the outcomes of extrinsic and intrinsic contests between these parasitoids when they are simultaneously exposed to *C. simplex* egg masses. *Trissolcus oenone* was the superior competitor in extrinsic and intrinsic contests. Finally, we recorded the antennal responses of *T. basalis* to egg extracts of *N. viridula*, to tentatively identify potential contact kairomones used by this parasitoid to recognise and accept hosts. We discuss our results in the context of combining behavioural and chemical ecological techniques for pre-release risk assessments of classical biological control agents.
